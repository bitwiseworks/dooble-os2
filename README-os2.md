# Port of Dooble Browser to OS/2

This repository is an effort to port [Dooble Browser](https://github.com/textbrowser/dooble) to the OS/2 operating system.

It is not a direct fork but a separate repository with its own history to distinguish OS/2-specific patches from the main development. It is synchronized with the main development line from time to time using updstream date-like tags (`YYYY.MM.DD`) as merge points.
